# Interface:
In python,The interface concept isnot explicitly available, like available in other language e.g.Java

In Python,an interface is an abstarct class which contains only abstarct method but not a single concrete method.
 
## Rules:
* All methods of an interface is abstract.
* We can not create object of interface.
* If a class is implementing an interface it has to define all the methods given in that interface.
* If a class doesnot implement all the methods declared in the interface, the class must be declared abstract.
  
## Use of Interface:
When all the features need to be implemented differently for different objects.
